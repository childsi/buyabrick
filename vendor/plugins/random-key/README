RandomKey
===============

Plugin to generate a unique random key.

Usage:

  class Operation < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_random_key :random_key
  end
  
After creating the object the specified attribute will have a value like: "ydCQyK5HpC"

You may also specify the size of the string and whether to use numbers, 
upcases letters, downcases letters, or all of them.

  class Operation < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_random_key :key, :size => 20, :include => :numbers
  end

  class Video < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_random_key :random_id, :include => [:numbers, :downcases]
  end

In case you don't want to expose ids and you can't use a named permalink
because there isn't a descriptive attribute in your model, you can use RandomKey.

Be sure to redefine to_param method and change your find methods if using RandomKey
as permalink.

Enjoy!

Feedback and bugs report are always welcome.
